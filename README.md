# Quote Web Crawler

## Learning how to interact with the Web

This is a project I created to learn how to create web crawlers.

The internet is vast and full of knowledge. Google uses web crawlers to learn about new websites being created and showcasing the most popular pages first on their search engine. 
Other companies are using web crawlers to return information such as updating numbers in a sales period.

To understand the concept of a web crawler, I created a script that will find a quotes web page and gather information about the quotes and authors on that page.

This is extremely useful when generating a spreadsheet of data for further analysis.
